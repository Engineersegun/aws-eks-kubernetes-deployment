Tech Stack: 
Docker, Amazon Web Services (AWS ECR), Nginx, Bash/Terminal
📋 Project Overview
Developed a streamlined workflow to containerize a web application and deploy it to a secure, cloud-based private registry. This project demonstrates the ability to bridge the gap between local development and cloud infrastructure, ensuring that applications are portable, scalable, and ready for production environments.

🚀 Key Achievements
Containerized a Web Server: Created a custom Dockerfile to build an Nginx-based image, optimizing the delivery of static web content.

Cloud Infrastructure Setup: Configured and managed an Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) to host private Docker images.

Secure Authentication: Implemented secure CLI-based authentication between a local development environment and AWS using IAM credentials and the AWS CLI.

Image Versioning: Established a tagging convention to manage image versions and ensure reliable deployments.

🛠️ Technical Workflow
Build: Developed the Dockerfile and configured environment-specific assets.

Verify: Conducted local testing by mapping ports and running containers in detached mode.

Authenticate: Utilized get-login-password via AWS CLI to establish a secure tunnel to the ECR registry.

Push: Tagged and migrated the local image to the cloud using the Docker CLI.
